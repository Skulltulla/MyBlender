# Vertices

## Vertex Creation

Vertex creation requires at least one object to be in the scene because if an object is not selected, then you cannot enter **Edit Mode** to create new vertices. Also the "Add Object" selection does not contain a "Vertex" option that will create an Object with a single vertex.

To create a single vertex from an Object/Mesh, enter **Edit Mode** and then select everything and then use the **Merge** operation.

While in **Edit Mode** with nothing selected, use `CTRL MOUSE-RIGHT` to create a vertex.

## Auto Merge

    Activate Tool and Workspace Settings > Options > Auto Merge
