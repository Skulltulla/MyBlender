# Cameras

## Local Camera

Determines what **Camera Perspective** `NUMPAD 0` will use. In the 3D View there is a triangle that will be filled for the Camera that is selected as the Local Camera.

The default file has a Camera in the scene and it is applied as the Local Camera.

If this is enabled and its value is cleared, then switching to Camera Perspective will result in the one of the first created cameras being applied as the Local Camera.

## Camera Perspective

`NUMPAD 0`

> TIP: Use **Walk/Fly Navigation** instead of toggling **Lock to Camera**
